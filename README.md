Ten Seconds
===========

Ten Seconds is an experiment. I started this experiment because I wanted to scream about something, but I did not want to wake up the kids. 

Anything typed into the message box will appear on anyone's browser that has the page loaded. After ten seconds, the items are deleted from the server. Each client refreshes on a one-second interval and removes old posts while adding new posts.

I built this in about an hour using AngularJS, Twitter Bootstrap, and Idiorm/Paris.
